## What is this?

This is a simple perceptual decision-making experiment where you watch a cloud of moving dots and decide whether the coherent motion is **leftward** or **rightward**. Some proportion of dots (the "coherence") move together in one direction, while the rest move randomly.

This paradigm has been foundational in understanding:
- How the brain accumulates noisy evidence over time
- The speed-accuracy tradeoff in decision-making
- Neural mechanisms of choice (see: Shadlen & Newsome's work on area MT/LIP)

## 🚀 Quick Start: Deploy Your Own

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Easiest)

1. **Fork this repository** (click "Fork" in the top right)
2. Go to your fork's **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under "Source", select **main** branch and **/ (root)** folder
4. Click **Save**
5. Your game will be live at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/dot-motion-task/`

### Option 2: Run Locally

Just open `index.html` in any modern browser. That's it—no server needed!

## 🔧 How to Modify

The entire experiment is in a single `index.html` file. Open it in any text editor.

### Easy Modifications (Change Values)

Look for the **ADJUSTABLE PARAMETERS** section:

```javascript
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// ADJUSTABLE PARAMETERS - Try changing these!
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
const [coherence, setCoherence] = useState(0.3);        // 0.0 to 1.0
const [numDots, setNumDots] = useState(100);            // total dots
const [stimulusDuration, setStimulusDuration] = useState(1000); // ms
```

And the **DISPLAY CONSTANTS**:

```javascript
const CANVAS_SIZE = 300;
const DOT_RADIUS = 2;
const DOT_SPEED = 3;          // pixels per frame
const APERTURE_RADIUS = 120;  // circular viewing window
```

### Medium Modifications (Add Features)

**Add a confidence rating:**
After each response, ask participants to rate their confidence (1-5). Store this in `trialData`.

**Add a response deadline:**
Force a response within X milliseconds, or record it as a "miss."

**Change the motion directions:**
Instead of left/right, try up/down or use 4 directions.

**Add practice trials:**
Include 5 easy trials (high coherence) before the main experiment.

### Advanced Modifications (New Paradigms)

**Psychometric curve:**
Run multiple coherence levels within a session and plot accuracy vs. coherence.

**Drift Diffusion Model:**
Fit a DDM to RT distributions and estimate drift rate, boundary, and non-decision time.

**Asymmetric rewards:**
Make one direction worth more points. Does this induce bias?

## 📊 Understanding the Code

### Key Concepts

**Signal vs. Noise Dots:**
```javascript
dots.push({
    x: ...,
    y: ...,
    isSignal: Math.random() < coherence  // This is the key line!
});
```

Each dot is randomly assigned as "signal" (moves coherently) or "noise" (moves randomly) based on the coherence parameter.

**Motion Update:**
```javascript
if (dot.isSignal) {
    // Signal dots move in the coherent direction
    newX = dot.x + DOT_SPEED * directionRef.current;
} else {
    // Noise dots move in a random direction
    const randomAngle = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2;
    newX = dot.x + Math.cos(randomAngle) * DOT_SPEED;
    newY = dot.y + Math.sin(randomAngle) * DOT_SPEED;
}
```

**Reaction Time Measurement:**
```javascript
setStimulusStartTime(Date.now());  // When stimulus appears
// ...
const rt = Date.now() - stimulusStartTime;  // When response occurs
```

## 🧠 Discussion Questions

1. **Coherence threshold:** At what coherence level does your performance drop to chance (50%)? What does this tell you about perceptual limits?

2. **Speed-accuracy tradeoff:** If you respond faster, does your accuracy decrease? How would you test this systematically?

3. **Evidence accumulation:** Why does longer stimulus duration generally improve accuracy (up to a point)? What model of decision-making does this support?

4. **Defining "decision":** When exactly does the "decision" happen—when you see the stimulus, when you feel certain, or when you press the key?

5. **The (A, a₀) framework:** What is the action set A in this task? What factors make up the "problem situation" a₀?
